      <p>If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.</p>

      <p>If all the numbers from 1 to 500 (five hundred) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>
      <p>If all the numbers from 1 to 5,000 (five thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>
      <p>If all the numbers from 1 to 50,000 (fifty thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>
      <p>If all the primes from 1 to 100,000 (one hundred thousand) were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>

      <p><em>NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.</em></p>
