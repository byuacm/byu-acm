    TheYHack is Brigham Young University's 24-hour hackathon event.
    Check back here later for more information!

  <section>
    <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
    <p>
      A hackathon can be thought of as an "invention marathon".
      Rather than breaking into computer systems, you start from scratch to create something new and innovative.
      You may form teams, or work on your own.
      For it to be eligible for prizes, your project must have been started during the Hackathon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a great opportunity to get started on learning that new framework,
      try to change the world, or if you'd like, you can just work on homework and enjoy the hackathon atmosphere!
    </p>
    <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>
