Contest Site Information

(Link: MAP OF WHERE TALMAGE IS AND WHERE TO PARK)
Detailed maps and pictures are available here.

The contest will be held in basement of the Talmage Building (TMCB).  <a href='map.byu.edu/'>Here</a> is a map of the campus, just search Talmage to find the building.  You can park in the lot immedietly north of the Talmage, or the larger lot a little further north, free after 6:00 PM on Friday and all day Saturday.  (Do not park in reserved spaces, or in the police parking close to the small lot)

Check-in is at the banquet Friday evening, in the Talmage Building during practice time, and in the Talmage Building on Saturday.

Contest Schedule

Most sites in the region have a pizza party on Friday night (at the practice contest), and a banquet on Saturday.  Since many teams have a long drive ahead of them on Saturday, we invert this schedule.  We have a welcome banquet for meeting the competition on Friday night, and a pizza party immediately after the contest on Saturday (so that we can conclude earlier).

This schedule is subject to change - specifically, if the region advances the time of practice session, we'll hold the banquet earlier.

Friday, October 25:

         5:30-6:45     Check in and banquet - see below

	     7:00-9:00     Check in and official practice time using the online submission system

Saturday, October 26:

         8:30-9:30     Late check-in, breakfast, free lab time to warm up

         9:30-9:45     Meeting for all participants

        10:00-3:00     COMPETITION / Lunch provided

         3:00-3:30     Results calculation

         3:15-4:15     Pizza party in the Gallery, door prizes, and results announced

We are currently planning the Friday banquet to be held at Brick Oven from 5:30 PM - 6:45 PM. Brick Oven is located at 111 East 800 North, Provo, UT 84606 (across the road from the southeast corner of BYU campus).  All teams are encouraged to come, but I recommend arriving by 6:15 PM.  Please tell the hostess you are with the ACM group (we are trying to reserve a room for all of the ICPC participants).  The hostess will have a list of schools and team names that we will pay for. Brick Oven has plenty of parking, plus there is a BYU parking lot across the road that are for public use after 4:00 PM on Friday and all day Saturday.

Brick Oven is very close to the Talmage Building and you can easily walk from one to the other. If trying to walk to the Talmage Building from Brick Oven, walk in a northeast direction. You will walk up a hill and find Campus Drive, a road that runs next to many of BYU's buildings. The Talmage Building is on the east side of the road, right next to the small booth and crossing arms leading to underground parking. The computer labs are in the west side of the building.

The official practice time will be on Friday after dinner.  The regional judges will operate their servers and contestants will be given a few practice problems that parallel the format of the actual problems on Saturday.  All teams are strongly encouraged to attend.  This gives you a chance to debug your input/output techniques prior to the contest.  If you are unable to come to dinner, please check in with us in the west lobby area of the Talmage Building after 7:00 PM Friday. 

Teams may also check in on Saturday morning, but you'll miss the official practice time.  Your team must check in by 9:30 AM on Saturday, October 26. 

The contest runs from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and is sometimes slightly extended for fairness purposes.  For competition details, please see the ACM site.

Because many teams drive a long distance to arrive, I have moved the restaurant dinner to Friday night and kept the post-contest activities to a minimum.  Note that on Saturday we will likely finish our pizza before the official results are known - we'll have a small drawing (with fun prizes) and then announce the results.

Note

There is a no smoking policy on all of BYU campus. 

Coaches

There are no official coach activities this year. During the competition coaches are welcome to briefly photograph their teams (with an escort), but should remain outside of the competition areas otherwise. We are working on scheduling a nice tour of BYU campus for any interested coaches. Please let us know if you are interested in that.

Lodging Information

There are plenty of hotels/motels in Provo that are close to BYU campus. Contact us if you have difficulties in securing lodging and we will try to assist you.
