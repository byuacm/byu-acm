  <h4>Education</h4>
  <p>
    This is why we're here at BYU, right?
    But beyond the learning we do in the classroom, there are other topics that are important to helping us transition into the workplace.
    Plus, it's fun to learn cool stuff!  Activities include:
  </p>
  <p>
    Tech talks covering subjects such as machine learning, big data, and technologies used in the real world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Programming Competitions:
    Once per semester, we have a four hour coding competition.

  <h4>Service</h4>
  <p>
    We are all blessed with talents and abilities and now BYU ACM is providing opportunities to use those to help others!
  </p>
  <p>
    ACM helps host “Discover STEM”, a middle school career fair at BYU.
    We also are always looking for opportunities to tutor and help all students, especially minorities and those K-12 get involved with computer science.
